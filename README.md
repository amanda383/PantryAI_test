# PantryAI

PantryAI is an AI app that generates recipes based on ingredients that you have! 
Why was this created you may ask. Well as a college student that often buys food thinking they will use them but instead. the food is often left unused. Whether it is due to not knowing how to include it in a dish, or from leftovers never being finish. In fact, 2.3 million tonnes of avoidable household food waste is produced in Canada every year.

Thus I wanted to bring an awareness to this and a solution. PantryAI will help you scan through ingredients that you might have and generate recipes based on your preferences and dietery restrictions.
